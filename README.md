## Roadmap

To see the future features, see [Projects](https://github.com/cftad/ReLock/projects).

### Current State

At the moment there are two separate applications, the legacy winforms app, and the rebuild WPF. [Fody](https://github.com/Fody/Fody) and [Costura](https://github.com/Fody/Costura) are used to embed `ReLock.Core` as part of the main executables.

- **ReLock (WIP)** - The new WPF app, created to enable more control over the styling to better emulate the lockscreen.

- **ReLock.Core** - Used for shared logic which can be used by both the WPF and Winforms apps.

## Build Process

Some of the methods used to obtain information from the local machine require accessing the registry, this is done to avoid lengthy calls to system APIs. As a result it is important that care is taken to ensure the application is built for its target platform (x86) for 32 bit and (x64) for 64 bit systems, else _silent registry redirection_ will occur and the application will fail to launch.

### Requirements

- `.NET 4.6.2`

## How To Use

[Download](/releases) the latest version.

 _Usage of ReLock for attacking targets without prior mutual consent is illegal. It is the end userâ€™s responsibility to obey all applicable local laws. We assume no liability and are not responsible for damage caused as a result of misuse._
